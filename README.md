# Render96ex-Portmaster-release-music-fix
READ BEFORE INSTALLING v0.1.0!!!
MAKE SURE YOU DELETE ALL THE FILES INSIDE THE AUDIO FOLDER (roms/ports/Render96ex/dynos/audio) BEFORE COPYING IN THE NEW ONES!! THE GAME WILL VERY LIKELY NOT BOOT IF YOU DO NOT DELETE THEM!!

This mod or fix fixes the music crashes in the portmaster release of Render96ex with a few extras such as higher quality music and a build with some custom music.

v0.1.0 (Render96ex music crash fix) includes:
  no more music causing crashes (I'm pretty sure. Please tell me if you do find a certain level that crashes.),
  higher quality music

v0.1.0-custom (Render96ex music crash fix + custom music) includes:
  no more music causing crashes (I'm pretty sure. again, please tell me if you do find a certain level that crashes.),
  higer quality music,
  custom music in some stages to make your experience just a little more unique

NOTE: both of these builds use the song "Coincentration" from SM64 DS because I couldn't find a high quality version of the "Fourth Floor" theme in the original Render96ex.

Fixed songs include:
  Wing Cap/Vanish Cap/Shell theme,
  Hazy Maze Cave,
  Final Bowser's theme,
and more!

Custom songs include:
  Slippery Slide (CCM slide) (by me),
  Dangerous Slide (TTM slide) (by me),
  Tick Tock Clock from MK DS plays in Tick Tock Clock,
  Balloon Mario theme from SM64 DS plays while using the Vanish Cap,
  Flying Owl theme from SM64 DS plays while using the Shell, and Coincentration from SM64 DS over the Fourth Floor theme.
