# Render96ex-Portmaster-release-music-fix
Fixes the music crashes in the portmaster release of Render96ex with a few extras such as higher quality music and a build with some custom music.

Fixed songs include:
-Wing Cap/Vanish Cap/Shell theme
-Hazy Maze Cave
-Final Bowser's theme
And more!

Custom songs include:
-Slippery Slide (CCM slide) (by me)
-Dangerous Slide (TTM slide) (by me)
-Tick Tock Clock from MK DS plays in Tick Tock Clock
-Balloon Mario theme from SM64 DS plays while using the Vanish Cap
-Flying Owl theme from SM64 DS plays while using the Shell

I've worked pretty hard to find the root of the crashing issue so I hope you enjoy!!
